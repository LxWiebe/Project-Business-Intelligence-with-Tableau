## 1. Ramen Data Set

Ramen is one of the best dishes in hisrtory of mankind. To my delight I was able to find a data set which contained a ranking for instant ramen. Fresh cookked ramen are of course better than instant ramen, but if you donÂ´t have time to cook or are just lazy instant ramen the way to go. 

## 2. Exploration
The data set is quite clear. There are six dimensions (id, url, brand, variety, style and country) and only one measure: stars (which represents the ranking of the ramen). Of the six dimensions four are relevant to the analysis.

## 3. Analysis
**
**1. Country Mapping**
- Counting ramen units and mapping them on the world map with the built in function of Tableau.
- Exchanging  the circle shape for a ramen icon, which was downloaded from the web, cropped and put in the shape folder.
- Enlarging the size of the icons to make better visible.
**Most ramen units have South East Asia as origin, which is easier to identify on the world map.**

**2. Country Ranking (absolute units of ramen)** 
- Ranking was included to show the actual numbers.
- Also a share was added, which has to be done with a calculated field.
**Top 9 countries (18% of all countries from the data set) produced exactly 80% of the different ramen units in the set.** 

**3. Pack Pie Chart**
- Here is the mandotory pie chart :) 
- Outlier dimensions (can, bar and restaurant) were excluded. 
**Packs and cups make 75% percent for total packaging.** 

**4. Variety**
- The varity vizualisation counts the different flavours in the data set. A tree map was picked to show the widespread variation of the different flavour descriptions. Please note that the whole string of the description was analyzed. For a detailed and meaningful analysis the substrings should be analyzed. 
**140 Flavours were counted more than once. 2556 flavours are unique.**

**5. Brands Rating**
- Only brands with more than five ratings were taken into account, to make sure that the average rating.
- A average rating for all brands was included into the chart as a line to make the comparison easier. 

**6. Country Rating**
- Based on the brand ranking chart is a country ranking was included.

**7. Ramen Rating Germany**
- To identify the best ramen you can get in Germany a five index rating was included.
- The ramen name was manually copied from the URL link in the data set and the field was manually changed.
- All ramen are from the same company Nissin.
